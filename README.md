# smart_list
Implement the "lss" command in Python.

The command needs to accept one optional argument: a path to the directory or file, similar to the "ls" command.

Make it as general as possible. The goal is to find sequences of files that can be concatenated together. 
Please don't rely on specific characters as delimiters since we can't control how artists name their files. 
And don't assume anything about the zero-padding.

> Please Note: This code is written to work with Python 3 and 2 both, so if you see the results inside parentheses you are probably running Python 2.x

> Also Note: This is the first iteration of the code and there are number of cosmetic changes/error handling/testings are possible/required. 

### Usage:
* Clone the repo
* In a terminal or shell, cd to the cloned directory
* In the same terminal run:
  * python lss.py /path/to/directory
